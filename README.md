# google-results-page
Part 2 of TOP's Google Project
This was a more difficult version of the Google Homepage project, and included a lot more elements I needed to design and align. It was fun figuring out how to style the elements to look like a real google results page, and it was interesting discovering new ways of making things work. I learnt a lot during this project, and feel like I can do much more with HTML and CSS.
